SEA Catering. Dibuat untuk memenuhi Technical Challenge Software Engineering Academy Compfest

## About Web

SEA Catering has recently gained a lot of attention for providing customizable healthy meals
that can be delivered to cities across Indonesia. What started as a small business has now
gone viral, leading to a huge increase in orders from customers all over the country. To keep
up with this rapid growth and ensure our customers have a better experience, weâ€™ve decided
to invest in a web or mobile app.
The app will help streamline the ordering process, allow customers to customize their meals,
see detailed nutritional information, and improve delivery logistics. Weâ€™re looking for
someone to help bring this idea to life, a platform that will not only support our growing
business but also make eating healthy more accessible for everyone in Indonesia.
